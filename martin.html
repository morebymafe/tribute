          <p id="img-caption">"Along the way of life, someone must have sense enough and morality
            enough to cut off the chain of hate and evil. The greatest way to do that is
            through love. I believe firmly that love is a transforming power than can lift
            a whole community to new horizons of fair play, goodwill, and justice." - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
